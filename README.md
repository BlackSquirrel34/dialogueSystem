# Dialogue Management Module

Project was developed in a self-organized team of four student develoeprs. The source code files attached are the part I contributed to the overall project, the dialogue management module.

The module gets information form the user that can help to give a recommendation.
This is done by filling pre-configured information slots, such as intent, area, and pricerange. 

#### Note: As the other components such as the input parser and output formatter 
of the Dialogue System are missing, the code isnâ€™t ready to be run.
